Hello, I'm Johanan. 

This website was created to be my portfolio and my blog. 
I have been using [wordpress](https://joyslearns.wordpress.com/) for a very long time to share some bits of information, and I have been using [gists](https://gist.github.com/johananj) to share quick references and how-to's to some of the things I work with. 
I now want to migrate to github.io. 

I have updated my profile. Checkout:
- [About](https://johananj.github.io/about/)
- [Work Experience](https://johananj.github.io/experience/)
- [Research Activities](https://johananj.github.io/research/)

I will soon start adding blog posts here.

Thanks for visiting.
